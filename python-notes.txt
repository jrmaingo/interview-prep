Sequences (List, strings, tuples)
S[start:end] -> slice of content from start elem (inclusive) to end elem (exclusive), omit to get elems until bounds of sequence
String
s[i] -> O(1) char at i

Array
A = [Val for i in range(arrLen)] -> defines array of arrLen with Val at each index
A = [[Val for i in range(arrLen)] for j in range(arrLen2)] -> defines 2D array

Dict
D = {} -> empty dictionary
D[k] -> access elem at key k
D[k] = val -> sets/inserts val with key k
del D[k] -> delete (remove) KVP for key k
D.clear() -> remove all elems
D.keys() -> iterable key sequence
D.values() -> iterable item sequence
D.items() -> iterable KVP sequence
